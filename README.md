# StarterProject

Features i have implemented:

	G
2 players using the same input,
basic unity terrain,
a player only controls one worm,
has hit points,
focus camera on active player,
minimum of 2 different weapons (default projectile & pickup weapon)
	
	VG small
added main menu & game over scene,
implemented custom character controller,
a worm can only move a certain range (based on stamina)
		
	VG medium
added pause scene (but no settings),
pickups:
health pickups that spawn at the end of every turn (regains 20HP),
weapon pick up at start of game that activates new weapon (instant kill weapon),

I was originally aiming towards only a G since I am fairly new to coding, but since I ended up implementing a couple VG features, I am now hoping for that although my code might not be very well optimized; and as you might notice, it has a couple bugs that I couldnâ€™t figure out how to fix, such as how to get the stamina bar to fill properly after every switch, how it sometimes skips a switch and instead of switching to the opposite player, it stays on the current player for an extra turn, and how the consumption of stamina increases after each turn, making their distance to move smaller and smaller.
